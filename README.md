# myCaffe

## my caffe framework practice.

- 1. some test files

    - 1.1 some caffe test tutorials

    - 1.2 train a small data set with caffe

- 2. AlexNet reimplement

    - 2.1 generate train and val list with given data set

    - 2.2 train AlexNet with pycaffe interface

    - 2.3 a simple accuracy computing script

- 3. more general scripts

    - mainly come from 2. which can be used in training / testing other classification network

    - however train / val list generator cannot be general unless given a standard file construction format

        - but changing some paths can be useful to other data sets
